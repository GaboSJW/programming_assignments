**i. A bivariate scatterplot**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(languageR)
ggplot(data = beginningReaders, mapping = aes(x = LogFrequency, y = LogRT),size =0.1) + 
  labs(title = "beginningReaders-word frequency and reaction time") +
  geom_point()
```


**ii. A boxplot with different fill colors**
```{r}
ggplot(data = danish, mapping = aes(x = Subject, y = LogRT,fill = Subject)) + 
  labs(title = "danish-reaction time among subjects") +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**iii. A plot of your choice that includes a `stat_summary` and a facet.**


```{r}
ggplot(data = english, mapping = aes(x = WordCategory, y = RTlexdec)) +
  labs(title = "english-wordcategory and reaction time") +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ AgeSubject) +
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = WordCategory, y = RTlexdec),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median)
```
